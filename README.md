### CheffyPix Demo Page

[Live Demo](https://nvizzutti.github.io/CheffyPix-Demo)

This is the demo page I created for the Android application, CheffyPix. The development team consisted of me and two others. You can find development details [here.](https://github.com/mike591/CheffyPix)

The demo page was built using JavaScript, jQuery, HTML, and CSS. It is meant to give an overview of of the application's purpose, UX and features.
